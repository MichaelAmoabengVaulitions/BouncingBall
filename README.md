# Bouncing Ball

This is an app built with Expo. It showcases the basic structure and features of a typical Expo project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. **Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the app**: Start the development server and launch the app on the Expo client by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open a new browser tab with the Metro Bundler and a QR code.

4. **Run on a device/emulator**: To run the app on a physical device or emulator, follow the instructions in the Expo client browser tab. You can scan the QR code with the Expo client app (available on iOS and Android) or choose to run the app on a simulator/emulator.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `/assets`: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other resources.
- `/components`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the app.
- `/screens`: Contains the main app screens or views.
- `/navigation`: Contains the app's navigation logic and configuration.
- `/utils`: Contains utility/helper functions.
- `/App.tsx`: The entry point of the app.
- `/App.test.ts`: Test file for the main app component.
- `/package.json`: The project's package.json file with dependencies and scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the Metro Bundler.
- `npm run android`: Runs the app on an Android device or emulator.
- `npm run ios`: Runs the app on an iOS device or simulator.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.

## Next Steps
